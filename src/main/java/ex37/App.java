Exercise 37 - Password Generator

Coming up with a password that meets specific requirements is something your computer can do.
And it will give you practice using random number generators in conjunction with a list of known values.

Create a program that generates a secure password.
Prompt the user for the minimum length, the number of special characters, and the number of numbers.
Then generate a password for the user using those inputs.

Example Output

What's the minimum length? 8
How many special characters? 2
How many numbers? 2
Your password is aurn2$1s#

Constraints

Use lists to store the characters youâ€™ll use to generate the passwords.
Ensure that the generated password is random.
Ensure that there are at least as many letters are there are special characters and number.
